    "In the following code , only two of the function usages are needed. One is `is_valid(self, state)`, which is to determine if the current state is legal; the other is `is_satisfy(self, state)`, which is to determine if the current board meets the win condition. \n",
    "The type of state is [], which stores the tuples(a, b), representing the positions of the queens in it.\n",
    "In the first line of the code you can see N = 5, this is the size of the test.\n",

    "## Question 1: You should complete the function `bts()`. (0.8 points)\n",
    "You can only use iterative way, not recursive. Using recursion will incur a **20% penalty**. And you can add any function you want. \n",
    "## Question 2: You should complete the function `improving_bts()` or `min_conflict()`. (0.2 points)\n",
    "For `improving_bts()`, You can select one or more methods of the three methods below:Minimum Remaining Value, Least constraining value, Forward checking. You should have a good performance **when N = 16 without GUI**. \n",

    "* That you understand every line of your code, not just copy from somewhere \n",
    "* That your program compiles correctly\n",
    "* Correctness of the program logic \n",
    "* That the result is obtained in a reasonable time \n",
